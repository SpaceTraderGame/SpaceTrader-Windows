The alien race which produced this artifact seems keen on getting it back, however, and may hinder the carrier. Are you, for a price, willing to deliver it?",
			"This is professor Berger. I thank you for delivering the alien artifact to me. I hope the aliens weren't too much of a nuisance. I have transferred 20000 credits to your account, which I assume compensates for your troubles.",
			"A trader in second-hand goods offers you 3 sealed cargo canisters for the sum of 1000 credits. It could be a good deal: they could contain robots. Then again, it might just be water. Do you want the canisters?",
			"This is Colonel Jackson of the Space Corps. An experimental ship, code-named \"Dragonfly\", has been stolen. It is equipped with very special, almost indestructible shields. It shouldn't fall into the wrong hands and we will reward you if you destroy it. It has been last seen in the Baratas system.",
			"A small ship of a weird design docked here recently for repairs. The engineer who worked on it said that it had a weak hull, but incredibly strong shields. I heard it took off in the direction of the Melina system.",
			"Hello, Commander. This is Colonel Jackson again. On behalf of the Space Corps, I thank you for your valuable assistance in destroying the Dragonfly. As a reward, we will install one of the experimental shields on your ship. Return here for that when you're ready.",
			"A ship with shields that seemed to be like lightning recently fought many other ships in our system. I have never seen anything like it before. After it left, I heard it went to the Regulas system.",
			"A small ship with shields like I have never seen before was here a few days ago. It destroyed at least ten police ships! Last thing I heard was that it went to the Zalkon system.",
			"Colonel Jackson here. Do you want us to install a lightning shield on your current ship?",
			"A hacker conveys to you that he has cracked the passwords to the galaxy-wide police computer network, and that he can erase your police record for the sum of 5000 credits. Do you want him to do that?",
			"While reviewing the plans for Dr. Fehler's new space-warping drive, Dr. Lowenstam discovered a critical error. If you don't go to Daled and stop the experiment within ten days, the time-space continuum itself could be damaged!",
			"Dr. Fehler can't understand why the experiment failed. But the failure has had a dramatic and disastrous effect on the fabric of space-time itself. It seems that Dr. Fehler won't be getting tenure any time soon... and you may have trouble when you warp!",
			"Upon your warning, Dr. Fehler calls off the experiment. As your  reward, you are given a Portable Singularity. This device will, for one time only, instantaneously transport you to any system in the galaxy. The Singularity can be accessed  by clicking the \"J\" (Jump) button on the Galactic Chart.",
			"We received word that aliens will invade Gemulon seven days from now. We know exactly at which coordinates they will arrive, but we can't warn Gemulon because an ion storm disturbs all forms of communication. We need someone, anyone, to deliver this info to Gemulon within six days.",
			"Do you wish us to install the fuel compactor on your current ship? (You need a free gadget slot)",
			"Alas, Gemulon has been invaded by aliens, which has thrown us back to pre-agricultural times. If only we had known the exact coordinates where they first arrived at our system, we might have prevented this tragedy from happening.",
			"This information of the arrival of the alien invasion force allows us to prepare a defense. You have saved our way of life. As a reward, we have a fuel compactor gadget for you, which will increase the travel distance by 3 parsecs for any ship. Return here to get it installed.",
			"A strange disease has invaded the Japori system. We would like you to deliver these ten canisters of special antidote to Japori. Note that, if you accept, ten of your cargo bays will remain in use on your way to Japori. Do you accept this mission?",
			"Thank you for delivering the medicine to us. We don't have any money to reward you, but we do have an alien fast-learning machine with which we will increase your skills.",
			"A recent change in the political climate of this solar system has forced Ambassador Jarek to flee back to his home system, Devidia. Would you be willing to give him a lift?",
			"Ambassador Jarek is very grateful to you for delivering him back to Devidia. As a reward, he gives you an experimental handheld haggling computer, which allows you to gain larger discounts when purchasing goods and equipment.",
			"You are lucky! While docking on the space port, you receive a message that you won 1000 credits in a lottery. The prize had been added to your account.",
			"There is a small but habitable moon for sale in the Utopia system, for the very reasonable sum of half a million credits. If you accept it, you can retire to it and live a peaceful, happy, and wealthy life. Do you wish to buy it?",
			"Welcome to the Utopia system. Your own moon is available for you to retire to it, if you feel inclined to do that. Are you ready to retire and lead a happy, peaceful, and wealthy life?",
			"Galactic criminal Henry Morgan wants this illegal ion reactor delivered to Nix. It's a very dangerous mission! The reactor and its fuel are bulky, taking up 15 bays. Worse, it's not stable -- its resonant energy will weaken your shields and hull strength while it's aboard your ship. Are you willing to deliver it?",
			"Henry Morgan takes delivery of the reactor with great glee. His men immediately set about stabilizing the fuel system. As a reward, Morgan offers you a special, high-powered laser that he designed. Return with an empty weapon slot when you want them to install it.",
			"Morgan's technicians are standing by with something that looks a lot like a military laser -- if you ignore the additional cooling vents and anodized ducts. Do you want them to install Morgan's special laser?",
			"Captain Renwick developed a new organic hull material for his ship which cannot be damaged except by Pulse lasers. While he was celebrating this success, pirates boarded and stole the craft, which they have named the Scarab. Rumors suggest it's being hidden at the exit to a wormhole. Destroy the ship for a reward!",
			"Space Corps is indebted to you for destroying the Scarab and the pirates who stole it. As a reward, we can have Captain Renwick upgrade the hull of your ship. Note that his upgrades won't be transferable if you buy a new ship! Come back with the ship you wish to upgrade.",
			"The organic hull used in the Scarab is still not ready for day-to-day use. But Captain Renwick can certainly upgrade your hull with some of his retrofit technology. It's light stuff, and won't reduce your ship's range. Should he upgrade your ship?",
			"An alien with a fast-learning machine offers to increase one of your skills for the reasonable sum of 3000 credits. You won't be able to pick that skill, though. Do you accept his offer?",
			"A space monster has invaded the Acamar system and is disturbing the trade routes. You'll be rewarded handsomely if you manage to destroy it.",
			"We thank you for destroying the space monster that circled our system for so long. Please accept 15000 credits as reward for your heroic deed.",
			"A merchant prince offers you a very special and wondrous item for the sum of 1000 credits. Do you accept?",
			"An eccentric alien billionaire wants to buy your collection of tribbles and offers half a credit for each of them. Do you accept his offer?",
			"Law Enforcement is closing in on notorious criminal kingpin Jonathan Wild. He would reward you handsomely for smuggling him home to Kravat. You'd have to avoid capture by the Police on the way. Are you willing to give him a berth?",
			"Jonathan Wild is most grateful to you for spiriting him to safety. As a reward, he has one of his Cyber Criminals hack into the Police Database, and clean up your record. He also offers you the opportunity to take his talented nephew Zeethibal along as a Mercenary with no pay.",
			"A hooded figure approaches you and asks if you'd be willing to deliver some recently aquired merchandise to Endor. He's holding a small sculpture of a man holding some kind of light sword that you strongly suspect was stolen. It appears to be made of plastic and not very valuable. \"I'll pay you 2,000 credits now, plus 15,000 on delivery,\" the figure says. After seeing the look on your face he adds, \"It's a collector's item. Will you deliver it or not?\"",
			"Yet another dark, hooded figure approaches. \"Do you have the action fig- umm, the sculpture?\" You hand it over and hear what sounds very much like a giggle from under the hood. \"I know you were promised 15,000 credits on delivery, but I'm strapped for cash right now. However, I have something better for you. I have an acquaintance who can install hidden compartments in your ship.\" Return with an empty gadget slot when you're ready to have it installed.",
			"You're taken to a warehouse and whisked through the door. A grubby alien of some humanoid species - you're not sure which one - approaches. \"So you're the being who needs Hidden Compartments. Should I install them in your ship?\" (It requires a free gadget slot.)",
			"A member of the Royal Family of Galvon has been kidnapped! Princess Ziyal was abducted by men while travelling across the planet. They escaped in a hi-tech ship called the Scorpion. Please rescue her! (You'll need to equip your ship with disruptors to be able to defeat the Scorpion without destroying it.) A ship bristling with weapons was blasting out of the system. It's trajectory before going to warp indicates that its destination was Centauri.",
			"A ship had its shields upgraded to Lighting Shields just two days ago. A shipyard worker overheard one of the crew saying they were headed to Inthara.",
			"Just yesterday a ship was seen in docking bay 327. A trader sold goods to a member of the crew, who was a native of Qonos. It's possible that's where they were going next.",
			"The Galvonian Ambassador to Qonos approaches you. The Princess needs a ride home. Will you take her? I don't think she'll feel safe with anyone else.",
			"His Majesty's Shipyard: Do you want us to install a quantum disruptor on your current ship?",
			"The King and Queen are extremely grateful to you for returning their daughter to them. The King says, \"Ziyal is priceless to us, but we feel we must offer you something as a reward. Visit my shipyard captain and he'll install one of our new Quantum Disruptors.\""

These shortcut functions can be changed from the Shortcuts menu option in the Game menu.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the game you have a small spaceship of the Gnat type, armed with a simple pulse laser, and 1000 credits to start your ventures. While docked, you can buy or sell trade goods; buy or sell equipment for your ship; buy fuel, repairs or even a new ship at the Ship Yard; hire mercenaries; visit the bank to get a loan; get information on your status, the galaxy or nearby solar systems; and activate the warp to another " +
																														"system.\r\n\r\nWhen you have activated the warp, you materialise nearby the target system you selected. The last distance you have to travel on your impulse engines. During that time, you may encounter pirates, police ships, or other traders.";
		public static string	TradingString										= "Trading is the safest way to make money. You trade by buying goods at one solar system, and sell them at another solar system. Of course, you should try to make a profit. There are several ways to ensure you can indeed sell your goods for a higher price than you bought them.\r\n\r\nThe prices a system pays for goods are determined by several factors. First and foremost, there is the tech level of a system. Low-tech systems have relatively cheap natural resources (water, furs, food and ore), while high-tech systems have relatively cheap non-natural goods. In general, prices for natural goods increase with the level of technological development, while the other prices decrease. Note that the tech level also influences which goods are useful to the inhabitants of a system, and which they won't buy at all.\r\n \r\nOther influences are the type of government a system has (for instance, in an anarchy there is almost always a food shortage and a military state will never buy narcotics), the size of a system (the smaller the system, the greater the demand for imported goods), and extraordinary natural resources (or the lack of them). Lastly, special events may have a tremendous influence on prices: for instance, when a system is visited by a cold spell, furs are especially in high demand.\r\n\r\nOn the Short Range Chart, you can tap a system and ask for the Average Price List for that system. This list only takes into account the size, tech level and government of a system (and the special resources if you know about them), but may be a good indication on what price you can expect to get for your goods.\r\n\r\nNote that if you are a criminal (or worse), you have to use an intermediary to sell your goods, and this intermediary will take 10% of the profits.";
		public static string	TravellingString								= "To travel to another system, go to the Short Range Chart. The system where you currently are is in the centre of the screen. The wide circle shows how far you can travel on your current fuel tanks. If the circle is absent, you probably have no fuel and you should go to the Ship Yard to buy some.\r\n\r\nWhen you tap a system that is within reach, you get shown some information on that system, and a big Warp button, with which you can activate a warp. When you tap the Warp button, you get warped to the target system. You do not materialize on the system itself, but nearby. You have to travel the last few clicks on your impulse engines (which costs no fuel - fuel is only used to warp).\r\n\r\nDuring that time, you may meet police, pirates or other traders. The chance to meet any of them is determined by the government type of the system you are flying to. If you have a weak ship, you should probably stay away from systems which have lots of pirates. \r\n\r\nPolice ships will usually let a lawful trader pass by. If they suspect you may be trafficking illegal goods (that is, firearms or narcotics), they may ask you to submit to an inspection. If you don't have any illegal goods on board, just comply. If you do, and you let them inspect you, they will impound your goods and fine you. If you don't want to submit to inspection, you can try to flee from them (in which case they will attack you), attack them, or try to bribe them.\r\n\r\nPirates will usually attack you on sight. You can also attack them, flee from them, or surrender to them. If you surrender, they will steal from your cargo bays. If you don't have anything in your cargo bays, they will blow up your ship unless you pay them off with cash. Destroying a pirate will earn you a bounty.\r\n\r\nTraders will usually ignore you. However, you can become a pirate yourself and attack them. Sometimes, a trader who finds you too strong an opponent and who can't " +
																														"manage to flee from you, will surrender to you and let you steal from his cargo bays.";
		public static string	ShipEquipmentString							= "There are sevral types of ships available to you. You start out in a Gnat, which is the cheapest ship but one (the cheapest is the Flea, which is mainly used if you need to jump over a large distance, since it can travel up to 20 parsecs on one tank). At the Ship Yard, you can buy a new ship if you like and one is available. The availability of ships depends on the tech level of the system.\r\n\r\nShip equipment falls into three groups. Each ship can equip zero or more of each group. The ship type determines exactly how many. For instance, your Gnat can equip one weapon, zero shields and one gadget. \r\n\r\nThe first group consists of weapons. Three kinds of lasers are available, and the more lasers, or the more expensive lasers you equip, the more damage you do. The second group consists of shields. Two kinds of shields are available, and the more shields, or the more expensive shields you equip, the better you are defended against attacks. The last group consists of gadgets.\r\n\r\nAs gadgets, you can buy 5 extra cargo bays, a targeting system, a navigating system, an auto-repair system, or a cloaking device. Of the extra cargo bays you can equip more than one: of the others you don't have use for more than one. The cloaking device helps you fly undetected through space; the other three systems increase one of your skills (see Skills).\r\n\r\nBesides equipment slots, a ship has also one, two or three crew quarters. If you have more than one, you might hire mercenaries to accompany you on your trips.\r\n\r\nFinally, at the Ship Yard you can get your ship equipped with an escape pod, and at the bank you can get your ship insured, so you get compensated when you have to use your pod.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy a new ship, you trade in your old one, including all its equipment. Don't worry, the price you pay for your new ship takes this into account. You may even get money for the trade. Mercenaries will stay on your " +

		public static string	SkillsString										= "As a trader, you have need of several skills. You can set your skills on the New Commander screen at the start of the game.\r\n\r\nThe Pilot skill determines how well you fly your ship. Good pilots have an easier time escaping from a fight and dodging laser shots.\r\n\r\nThe Fighter skill determines how well you handle your weapons. While the actual damage you do with a weapon is solely determined by the weapon's power, the fighter skill determines whether you hit or not.\r\n\r\nThe Trader skill influences the price you have to pay for goods and equipment. A good trader pays considerably less than a bad trader.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Engineer skill determines how well you keep your ship in shape. Especially, an engineer manages to repair your hull and shield while traveling and during a fight. He may even reduce the damage done by an opponent to zero. A good engineer can also upgrade your weaponry a bit, so you do more damage.\r\n\r\nIf you fly a ship with extra crew quarters, you can hire mercenaries. These travel with you, for a certain sum of credits per day. The net effect of having a mercenary on board is that if the mercenary is better in a certain skill than you are, he will take over the tasks for which that skill is needed. So, if you are lacking a certain skill, a mercenary can compensate for that.\r\n\r\nAnother way to increase certain skills is to buy gadgets. Especially, a navigating system increases your pilot skill, an auto-repair system increases your engineer skill, and a targeting system increases your fighter skill.";

		public static string	AcknowledgementsString					= "This first version of \"Space Trader\" has been designed and programmed by me, Pieter Spronck, between July and September 2000. The game has been enhanced several times since then. It has been released as freeware under a GNU General Public License (GPL).\r\n\r\nI used CodeWarrior for PalmPilot, release 6. Since it was my first project with this environment, I often consulted the example code delivered with it. I also made some use of Matt Lee's code for his DopeWars program.\r\n\r\nA derivative work of DopeWars was SolarWars, a program by David J. Webb. This program is very similar to DopeWars, except that it has a space trading theme instead of a drug theme. Playing SolarWars, I was reminded of the eighties game Elite. While Elite was more like a 3D space combat program, the trading between solar systems was central to it, especially because that was the best way to make money and buy better equipment for your ship.\r\n\r\nI thought it would be fun to have a program for the PalmPilot which was a trading game like SolarWars, but which would resemble the trading, development and even the combat of Elite more. Thus Space Trader was born. I haven't tried to hide my source of inspiration, and you'll find some ideas in the game which are directly derived from Elite. Consider it a tribute.\r\n\r\nA great many thanks and a lot of admiration goes out to Alexander Lawrence (al_virtual@yahoo.com), who created the beautiful pictures which illustrate the game, including the ship designs. It's almost worth ditching your black&white Palm for to get a color one! \r\n\r\nSam Anderson (rulez2@home.com) converted Space Trader to a multi-segmented application (version 1.1.2). Sam also made a few small changes to the code, fixing bugs and correcting grammatical errors.  I wish to extend my thanks to him for that. Without Sam, players using Palm OS versions 2.x and 4.x would have had a lot more problems with this game.\r\n\r\n" +
																														"Samuel Goldstein (palm@fogbound.net) added most of the new functionalities for version 1.2.0. Among these great additions are four new quests, special encounters, the \"news\", trading with fellow traders in space, better black&white pictures, and many handy new features. Samuel brought new life to this game, and even I found it to be a lot of fun again. Many heartfelt thanks go out to Samuel, from me, and I expect from many players too.\r\n\r\nMany thanks also go out to the Space Trader beta testers, who pointed out several bugs and who suggested many ideas to better the game, a lot of which have been implemented:\r\n\r\nMichael Andersson\nJohn Austin\nBen Belatrix\nLee W.

		public static string	FirstStepsString								= "Here I will describe the steps you will undertake the first days as a trader:\r\n\r\nYou start by docking on some system. The specifics of that system are shown on the System Information screen. Take special note of any special resources the system might have. These influence the price you have to pay for certain goods. For instance, a system which has rich soil, usually sells food cheap, while a relatively lifeless system has little fauna and therefore expensive furs. \r\n\r\nAlso take note of any special events in the system. Special events usually means that certain things are expensive to buy, so you should stay clear from them in this system, but since special events last several days, it might be worth your while to return here later to sell something they especially need.\r\n\r\nIf there is a Special button on the System Information screen, tap it to see what the special offer is. You can always refuse, but it is good to know what special thing is available here.\r\n\r\nAfter you have examined the system on the System Information screen, if you have cargo, go to the Sell Cargo screen to sell it. Then, switch to the Ship Yard to buy a full tank of fuel, and repair your hull if you think it's necessary. If you want, you can let the program take care of the Ship Yard automatically when you arrive in a new system, by checking the appropriate choices in the Options menu.\r\n\r\nThen switch to the Short Range Chart to select your next target. Tap any system within the maximum range circle to get information on that system. Try to select a system which hasn't got too many pirates (unless to aspire a career as a bounty hunter), and which has a tech level which is opposite the tech level of your current system. That is, from an agricultural system you best travel to an industrial system to sell natural goods, while from an industrial system you best sell technologies to more backward systems. Use the Average " +
																														"Price List button to get an indication on the prices you might expect to sell your goods for. Goods that are displayed bold have an average selling price that is higher than the price you have to pay for those goods in the current system. Note that this isn't a guarantee, but it's better than nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen you have selected a system, you know what you want to sell there, and you can switch to the Buy Cargo screen to get some goods. Remember that Firearms and Narcotics are illegal goods, and you could get in trouble with the police if you traffick those. After having filled your cargo bays, return to the Short Range Chart, and Warp to the selected system.\r\n\r\nWhile in flight, flee from pirates, ignore traders and submit to police inspections if they ask you to (unless you are carrying illegal goods, in which case you must decide for yourself how you best handle them). Later on in the game, when you are ready for it, you might wish to become a pirate yourself and attack traders, or become a bounty hunter and attack pirates. However, with full cargo holds you best try to arrive on the target system in one piece, so you can sell your goods and make a profit.\r\n\r\nThere are many more things to Space Trader, but you can discover these by examining the screens, reading the help screens, reading the documentation, and simply by playing the game.\r\n\r\nHave fun!";
